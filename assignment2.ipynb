    "An accelerometer measures [specific force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_force) (i.e., mass-normalized non-gravitational force), or, acceleration relative to free-fall. That is, an accelerometer sitting on a table (with +z pointing up) will report a *positive* acceleration because the normal force of the table is preventing the accelerometer's free-fall. An accelerometer in free-fall will report 0 acceleration.\n",

The $3\\times 3$ matrix $R^\\text{b}_\\text{w}\\in\\text{SO}(3)$ encodes the *attitude*, or orientation, of the accelerometer w.r.t the world frame. Noise in accelerometer readings is captured with $\\boldsymbol{\\eta}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\Sigma_\\mathbf{a})$ and $\\mathbf{b}$, which is a slowly time-varying bias. Depending on the duration of the experiment, this bias can either be treated as a constant or as a random walk.\n",
    "\n",
    "This probabilistic measurement model is particularly useful in dynamic estimation tasks. However, this model makes the assumption that accelerometer has been calibrated for *misalignment errors* and *scale errors*. During the fabrication process, the accelerometer MEMS circutry must be placed on a die and into the [IC packaging](https://www.silicondesigns.com/tech). If the positioning is not perfect, a cross-axis sensitivity will arise where, e.g., acceleration signals solely in the x-axis will be coupled with the z-axis. Additionally, there may be a multiplicative scale factor error associated with the output of the accelerometer. These errors are captured by the matrix $M$ in the modified measurement model\n",
