    "## Estimating Tilt\n",
    "\n",
    "An IMU has x-y-z accelerometers (measuring linear acceleration) and x-y-z gyroscopes (measuring angular velocity). Using these measurements, we would like to measure the tilt angle of an IMU. Here, tilt refers to the roll (rotation about the x axis) and pitch (rotation about the y axis). Note that the yaw (rotation about the z axis) bias is unobservable when only given a gyro and an accelerometer, as we will discuss below.\n",
    "\n",
    "A naive solution for recovering tilt angle is to integrate the gyroscope measurements over time. However, noise and biases in the gyro measuring process would quickly cause this integration to diverge. Alternatively, accelerometer measurements can provide a measure of the angles, but these measurements are noisy and become distorted for  an accelerated body. By *fusing* these measurement sources together in a Kalman filter, we can leverage the best of both measurement sources.\n",

Using trigonometry, the tilt angles about x and y can be recovered given the accelerometer measurement (see [here](https://www.digikey.com/en/articles/using-an-accelerometer-for-inclination-sensing) for figures, equations, and discussions).
